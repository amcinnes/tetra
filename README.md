# Starting the server:

- Start the server

    npm install -g gulp
    gulp

- visit http://localhost:4000/

Alternatively, using Python instead of node:

- Start the server

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

- visit http://localhost:8000/

# Using the app:

- Use arrow keys to look, and WSAD to move
