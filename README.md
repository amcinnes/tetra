My idea is something like Minecraft but using [triakis truncated tetrahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triakis_truncated_tetrahedron) instead of cubes. It's not quite there yet.

# Starting the server:

- Start the server

      npm install -g gulp
      gulp

- visit http://localhost:4000/

Alternatively, using Python instead of node:

- Start the server

      python -m SimpleHTTPServer

- visit http://localhost:8000/

# Using the app:

- Use arrow keys to look, and WSAD to move
